# Home Panel

![Home Panel](../../images/user/home.png)

The Home Panel is your printer dashboard — a fully customizable grid of widgets showing everything you need at a glance. You choose what appears, where it goes, how big each widget is, and can rearrange everything with drag-and-drop.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — default home panel layout at 800x480, idle printer -->

---

## The Widget Grid

Your dashboard is built from **widgets** — individual cards that display printer information and controls. Widgets live on a flexible grid:

- The grid is **8 columns by 5 rows** on standard and large screens (6x4 on small screens)
- Each widget occupies one or more grid cells
- Widgets cannot overlap — the grid enforces clean layouts
- **Everything saves automatically** and persists across restarts and updates

When you first launch HelixScreen, a default layout is created with your printer image, print status, tips, and commonly used widgets. From there, you can customize everything.

---

## Edit Mode

Edit Mode is how you customize your dashboard layout. While in Edit Mode, all normal widget interactions (tapping to open overlays, etc.) are disabled so you can freely rearrange things.

### Entering Edit Mode

**Long-press** (press and hold for about half a second) **anywhere on the widget grid**. You'll see:

- A faint **grid of dots** appears showing the underlying grid structure
- **Corner brackets** appear on the widget under your finger, indicating it's selected
- All normal widget tap actions are disabled — you can touch anything without triggering it

The widget you long-pressed is automatically selected and ready to drag. You can start moving it immediately without lifting your finger.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — edit mode active: grid dots visible, one widget selected with corner brackets, toolbar at top -->

### Selecting a Widget

- **Tap any widget** to select it — animated corner brackets appear at its edges
- The corner brackets **pulse** gently to indicate the active selection
- **Tap empty space** to deselect the current widget
- Only one widget can be selected at a time

### Moving a Widget

1. **Select** a widget by tapping it (or it's auto-selected when you enter Edit Mode)
2. **Press and drag** the widget to a new position
3. As you drag, a **snap preview** appears showing where the widget will land:
   - **Blue/accent preview** = valid drop position
   - **Red preview** = invalid position (would overlap another widget or go off-grid)
4. **Release** to drop the widget — it snaps into the grid position with a smooth animation
5. If the position is invalid, the widget returns to its original spot

A faint outline stays at the widget's original position while dragging so you can see where it came from.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — mid-drag: widget floating, blue snap preview at target cell, faint origin ghost -->

### Resizing a Widget

Not all widgets are resizable — some (like Power and Shutdown) are always 1x1. For widgets that support resizing:

1. **Select** the widget by tapping it
2. Look for **thin edge lines** along the sides of the selected widget — these are the resize handles
3. **Drag from any edge** to resize in that direction
4. As you drag, two previews appear:
   - A thin border follows your finger exactly (pixel-tracking)
   - A grid-snapped preview shows the final size
5. The widget snaps to valid grid sizes based on its constraints:
   - Each widget has a **minimum** and **maximum** size (see the widget table below)
   - Resizing stops at the grid boundary
   - Resizing stops if it would overlap another widget
6. **Release** to apply the new size — the widget rebuilds at its new dimensions

Some widgets adapt their content based on size. For example, the Digital Clock shows just the time at 1x1, adds the date at 2x1, and shows uptime too at 2x2 or larger.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — widget being resized: edge handle visible, grid-snap preview showing new size -->

### Adding a Widget

There are two ways to add widgets:

**Method 1: Long-press empty space**
1. While in Edit Mode, **long-press on an empty area** of the grid
2. The Widget Catalog opens

**Method 2: Via Settings**
1. Go to **Settings > Home Widgets**
2. Toggle widgets on or off

**The Widget Catalog** shows all available widgets in a scrollable list. Each entry shows:
- Widget name and description
- Size badge (e.g., "2x1")
- Widgets already on your dashboard are **dimmed** and labeled "Placed"

Tap any available widget to add it. HelixScreen places it near where you long-pressed, or finds the best available spot if that area is occupied. If the grid is completely full, you'll need to remove a widget first.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — widget catalog open: scrollable list with widget names, descriptions, size badges, dimmed "Placed" entries -->

### Removing a Widget

1. **Select** the widget you want to remove
2. A **trash icon** appears — drag the widget to the trash, or tap the delete button
3. The widget is removed from your grid

Removing a widget doesn't delete any data — you can always add it back from the Widget Catalog.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — widget selected with trash icon visible in corner -->

### Resetting to Defaults

Tap the **Reset** button in the Edit Mode toolbar to restore the default widget layout. This resets positions and sizes, and restores the default set of enabled widgets. Your per-widget settings (like display mode preferences) are preserved.

The default layout places:
- **Printer Image** in the top-left (2x2)
- **Print Status** below it (2x2)
- **Tips** across the top-right (4x2)
- Remaining enabled widgets auto-fill the rest of the grid

### Exiting Edit Mode

- Tap the **Done** button in the toolbar
- Or **navigate away** to any other panel — Edit Mode exits automatically and saves your changes

### Hardware-Gated Widgets

Some widgets depend on specific hardware being detected by Klipper. If the hardware isn't present:

- The widget **won't appear** in the Widget Catalog
- If hardware is detected later (plugged in, configured), the widget becomes available automatically
- If hardware is removed after placing a widget, the widget **hides automatically** but keeps its grid position — it reappears if the hardware returns

| Widget | Required Hardware |
|--------|-------------------|
| AMS Status | AMS, AFC (Box Turtle), Happy Hare, ValgACE, or compatible MMU system |
| LED Light | Any LED strip configured in Klipper (neopixel, dotstar, output_pin) |
| Power | Moonraker power devices (PSU control, smart plugs) |
| Filament Sensor | `[filament_switch_sensor]` or `[filament_motion_sensor]` in Klipper |
| Humidity | `[temperature_sensor]` with humidity capability |
| Width Sensor | `[hall_filament_width_sensor]` in Klipper |
| Thermistor | Extra `[temperature_sensor]` entries beyond nozzle and bed |

---

## Display Modes: Stack vs. Carousel

The **Temperatures** and **Fan Speeds** widgets each support two visual modes:

### Stack Mode (Default)

Compact vertical rows showing all values simultaneously. Each row has an icon, current reading, and target (if applicable). Best when you want to see everything at once without swiping.

### Carousel Mode

Full-size swipeable pages with one item per page. Indicator dots at the bottom show which page you're on. Swipe left and right to browse.

**Temperatures carousel** — each sensor (nozzle, bed, chamber) gets its own full-size page with a large animated icon and temperature readout. The nozzle icon pulses when heating. Tap any page to open the temperature graph overlay for that sensor.

**Fan Speeds carousel** — each fan gets an interactive page with a **270-degree arc slider**. Drag the arc to change fan speed directly, without opening a separate control panel. The fan icon spins at a speed proportional to the actual fan RPM.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot side-by-side — temp stack mode (compact rows) vs temp carousel mode (single page with large icon) -->
<!-- TODO: Screenshot — fan carousel with arc slider dial -->

### Switching Modes

Go to **Settings > Home Widgets** and find the Temperatures or Fan Speeds widget. Change the display mode setting. Your preference is saved per widget and persists across restarts.

---

---

## Job Queue Manager

Tap the **Job Queue** widget to open the queue manager — a full-screen modal for managing your print queue.

### Queue State

At the top, you'll see the current queue state:

- **Queue: Ready** — the queue is active and will auto-print jobs in order
- **Queue: Paused** — the queue is paused; queued jobs won't start automatically

Tap the **Start** or **Pause** button to toggle the queue state.

### Job List

Below the state indicator, all queued jobs are listed with:

- **Filename** — the name of the queued G-code file
- **Time queued** — how long the job has been waiting (e.g., "Queued 2h 15m ago", "Just queued")

### Actions

**Start a print:** Tap any job in the list. If the printer is idle, the job is removed from the queue and printing begins immediately. If the printer is already printing, HelixScreen will let you know.

**Delete a job:** Tap the **trash icon** on the right side of any job row. The job is immediately removed from the queue.

**Close:** Tap the **X** button in the top-right corner to close the modal.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — job queue modal open: header with queue state, job list with filenames and time queued, trash icons -->

### Sync with Other Interfaces

The job queue is managed by Moonraker, so jobs added from Mainsail, Fluidd, or the Moonraker API appear here automatically. Likewise, jobs deleted or started from HelixScreen are reflected in those other interfaces.

## Grid Layout Details

### Grid Dimensions

The grid adapts to your screen size:

| Screen Width | Grid Size | Total Cells |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 480px and below | 6 columns x 4 rows | 24 |
| 481-700px | 6 columns x 4 rows | 24 |
| 701px and above | 8 columns x 5 rows | 40 |

### Auto-Placement

When widgets don't have an explicit position (newly added, or after a reset), HelixScreen places them automatically:

1. Larger widgets (multi-cell) are placed first to ensure they get contiguous space
2. Smaller widgets (1x1) fill the remaining gaps
3. Placement scans from top-left to bottom-right

### What Happens on Upgrade

When you update HelixScreen and new widgets are added:

- **Your existing layout is preserved** — nothing moves
- New widgets are appended with their default enabled/disabled state
- If a new widget is enabled by default, it auto-places into available grid space
- If the grid is full, new widgets stay disabled until you make room

If you downgrade and a widget type no longer exists, it's silently removed from your layout. Upgrading again restores it.

---

## Configuring Widgets in Settings

Go to **Settings > Home Widgets** for additional widget configuration:

- **Toggle widgets** on and off — disabled widgets free up their grid space
- **Display mode** — switch between Stack and Carousel for Temperatures and Fan Speeds widgets
- **Macro assignment** — choose which macro to run for Macro Button 1 and 2

Changes in Settings take effect when you return to the Home Panel.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — Settings > Home Widgets panel: toggle switches, display mode options -->

---

## Active Tool Badge

On printers with a toolchanger (IDEX, multi-head, tool-changing systems), the Home Panel displays an active tool badge:

- Shows the current active tool (e.g., "T0", "T1", "T2")
- Updates automatically when tools are switched during a print or via macros
- Color-coded to match the tool's filament color (if configured via Spoolman or AMS)
- Only visible on multi-tool printers — single-extruder printers won't see this

---

## Emergency Stop

The red **Emergency Stop** button in the top bar halts all printer motion immediately. By default, a confirmation dialog appears before executing. You can disable the confirmation in **Settings > Safety > E-Stop Confirmation**.

---

## LED Controls

Tap the **LED** widget to open the LED Control Overlay — a full control panel for all your printer's lighting. What you see depends on your hardware.

### Strip Selector

If you have more than one LED strip configured, a row of chips at the top lets you pick which strip to control. The overlay heading updates to show the selected strip name.

### Color & Brightness (Klipper Native LEDs)

For neopixel, dotstar, and other Klipper-native strips:

- **Color presets**: 8 preset swatches — White, Warm White, Orange, Blue, Red, Green, Purple, Cyan
- **Custom color**: Tap the custom color button to open an HSV color picker. Pick any color — HelixScreen automatically separates it into a base color and brightness level
- **Brightness slider**: Adjust from 0-100%, independent of color selection
- **Color swatch**: Shows the actual output color (base color adjusted by current brightness)
- **Turn Off**: Stops any active effects and turns off the selected strip

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — LED control overlay: color presets, custom color picker, brightness slider -->

### Output Pin Lights

For `[output_pin]` lights (auto-detected by naming convention):

- **PWM pins**: Brightness slider from 0-100%
- **Non-PWM pins**: Simple on/off toggle
- Color controls are hidden since output pins don't support color

### LED Effects

If you have the [klipper-led_effect](https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect) plugin installed:

- Effect cards appear for each available effect, filtered to the currently selected strip
- The active effect is highlighted with an accent border
- **Stop All Effects** button kills all running effects at once
- Tap any effect card to activate it

### WLED Controls

For WLED network-connected strips:

- **On/Off toggle** to control the strip power
- **Brightness slider** from 0-100%
- **Preset buttons** for each WLED preset — fetched directly from your WLED device, with the active preset highlighted

### Macro Device Controls

Custom macro devices you've configured in [LED Settings](settings/led-settings.md) appear with controls matching their type:

- **On/Off devices**: Separate "Turn On" and "Turn Off" buttons
- **Toggle devices**: A single "Toggle" button
- **Preset devices**: Named buttons for each preset action

---

## Printer Manager

**Tap the Printer Image widget** to open the Printer Manager overlay. This is your central place to view and customize your printer's identity.

### Changing the Printer Name

1. Tap the **printer image** on the Home Panel to open the Printer Manager
2. Tap the **printer name** (shown with a pencil icon) — it becomes an editable text field
3. Type your new name (e.g., "Workshop Voron", "Printer #2")
4. Press **Enter** to save, or **Escape** to cancel

The name defaults to "My Printer" if left empty. It's saved to your config file and persists across restarts.

> **Tip:** You can also set the name directly in the config file under the `printer.name` key — see [Configuration Reference](../CONFIGURATION.md#name).

### Changing the Printer Image

1. Tap the **printer image** on the Home Panel to open the Printer Manager
2. Tap the **printer image** again (marked with a pencil badge) to open the Image Picker
3. The picker shows a scrollable list on the left and a live preview on the right
4. Choose from one of three sources:
   - **Auto-Detect** (default) — HelixScreen selects an image based on your printer type reported by Klipper
   - **Shipped Images** — Over 25 pre-rendered images covering Voron, Creality, FlashForge, Anycubic, RatRig, FLSUN, and more
   - **Custom Images** — Your own images (see below)
5. Tap an image to select it — your choice takes effect immediately

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — printer image picker: scrollable list on left, live preview on right -->

### Using Custom Printer Images

You can use your own printer photo or rendering:

**Option A: Copy to the custom images folder**

| Platform | Custom images directory |
|----------|----------------------|
| MainsailOS (Pi) | `~/helixscreen/config/custom_images/` |
| AD5M Forge-X | `/opt/helixscreen/config/custom_images/` |
| AD5M Klipper Mod | `/root/printer_software/helixscreen/config/custom_images/` |
| K1 Simple AF | `/usr/data/helixscreen/config/custom_images/` |

Copy a PNG, JPEG, BMP, or GIF file into the directory, then open the Image Picker — your image appears under the Custom Images section.

**Option B: Import from a USB drive**

1. Insert a USB drive containing image files into your printer's host
2. Open the Image Picker
3. A **USB Import** section appears at the bottom showing images found on the drive
4. Tap an image to import it — HelixScreen copies and converts it automatically
5. Once imported, the image appears under Custom Images and the drive can be removed

**Image requirements:**
- Formats: PNG, JPEG, BMP, or GIF
- Maximum file size: 5 MB
- Maximum dimensions: 2048x2048 pixels (resize before importing if larger)
- HelixScreen automatically generates optimized display variants

**Removing a custom image:**

Delete the image files from the `custom_images/` directory via SSH:

```bash
cd ~/helixscreen/config/custom_images/   # adjust path for your platform
rm my-printer.png my-printer-300.bin my-printer-150.bin
```

If the deleted image was active, HelixScreen falls back to auto-detect.

### Software Versions

Below the identity card, the overlay displays current software versions for Klipper, Moonraker, and HelixScreen, with update indicators when new versions are available.

### Hardware Capabilities

A row of chips shows detected hardware capabilities: Probe, Bed Mesh, Heated Bed, LEDs, ADXL, QGL, Z-Tilt, and others depending on your Klipper configuration.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot — printer manager overlay: name, image, versions, hardware capability chips -->
