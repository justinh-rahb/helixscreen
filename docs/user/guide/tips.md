# Tips & Best Practices

---

## Workflow Tips

**Temperature shortcuts**: Tap temperature displays on the Home panel to jump directly to temperature controls.

**Pre-print options**: These remember your choices per slicer — if you always mesh before PrusaSlicer prints, it persists.

**Quick homing**: Use "Home All" before starting manual positioning to ensure known coordinates.

**Save Z-offset during first layer**: Make baby step adjustments, then save while you can see the results.
