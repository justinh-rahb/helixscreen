These graphs reveal more than just optimal shaper settings - they diagnose mechanical problems.\n\nA healthy printer shows a single clean peak per axis; multiple peaks or broad humps indicate loose components, worn bearings, or frame flex. Asymmetric X vs Y graphs suggest axis-specific issues. Very low resonant frequencies (<30Hz) indicate something loose or heavy.\n\nCompare graphs over time - degrading results signal developing problems before they cause print failures. The recommended max acceleration correlates directly with mechanical quality. Use TEST_RESONANCES AXIS=X OUTPUT=raw_data for detailed analysis.",

The spool should rotate freely with minimal force. For Bowden setups, ensure PTFE tube ends are cut square and seated firmly.\n\nIf your extruder clicks or grinds intermittently, suspect the filament path before the extruder itself.

Inspect nozzles by looking at the tip - a worn orifice is visibly larger or oval-shaped.\n\nReplace brass nozzles after ~500g of abrasive filament or when quality degrades.

Expect 5-10°C variance due to measurement location differences, but consistent offsets beyond this suggest problems.\n\nEnsure sensor_type in printer.cfg matches your actual thermistor.
